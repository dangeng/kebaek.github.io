Hi! I am a third-year PhD student in [**Machine Learning**](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [**Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [**Aditi Raghunathan**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/) . I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I am broadly interested in understanding the interaction of deep neural networks and data. Currently, my research focuses on **out-of-distribution robustness**. Specifically, I want to better understand distribution shifts that occur in the wild and design ways to assess/improve the model's performance under such shifts with limited labeled data. I am also interested in **lifelong learning** especially understanding how foundation models can best adapt to new information.
