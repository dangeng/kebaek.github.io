Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in [**Machine Learning**](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [**Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and  [**Aditi Raghunathan**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aditirag/) . I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I am broadly interested in **theoretical machine learning**, **nonconvex optimization**, and their applications to **genetics and healthcare**. Currently, my research focuses on **out-of-distribution generalization**: both assessing and improving the performance of models when labeled data is limited. I am also interested in understanding how to properly fine-tune models in a **continual** fashion.
