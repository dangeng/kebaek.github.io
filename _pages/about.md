Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [**Professor Zico Kolter**](https://zicokolter.com/) and my work is supported by CMU's Presidential Fellowship in Machine Learning. I completed my 5th year Master's at UC Berkeley advised by [**Professor Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

I am broadly interested in **theoretical machine learning**, **nonconvex optimization**, and their applications to **genetics and healthcare**.
