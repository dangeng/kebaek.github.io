Hi! I am a 5th year Master's student at UC Berkeley advised by [**Professor Yi Ma**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). In 2020, I received a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Bioengineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning**, **nonconvex optimization**, and **genetics**. Currently, I am working on designing systems that can correctly extrapolate to out-of-distribution data under the domain generalization and continual learning frameworks. Previously, I've conducted extensive research in molecular biology.
